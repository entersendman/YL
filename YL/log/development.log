Tired of biting the entire way through your lip every time your sociopathic line manager barks something at you in totally nonsensical office jargon? I feel for you, but then I also kind of don’t. Because however many KPIs you’ve got to action by COB, trust me when I tell you that being a shot girl is endlessly more soul-destroying, and doesn't come with any of the perks you enjoy—like four-figure bonuses, interacting with mostly non-drunk people, and being able to wear pants to work.\r\n\r\nTry maintaining a rictus grin as you prowl the nightclub floor, a bottle of Apple Sourz in each clammy hand, Calvin Harris’ discography hijacking your eardrums for the third night in a row. Try having to hustle a crowd of leery city workers while the balls of your feet turn white with pain and your self-esteem disintegrates like a Rizla at a foam party. Now try doing that sober.\r\n\r\nI never thought I’d end up selling shots in a bar. After moving to London to study for a masters—which so far has amounted to little but an extra line on my resume—my sister introduced me to the world of promo work. It’s a profession that saw me flyering (being paid £6 [$10] an hour to dump bits of paper in a bin), nightclub hostessing (£8 [$12], an hour to pretend to be friends with strangers) and checking names on the door (in my experience, £10 [$16] an hour to listen to bouncers be racist in sub-zero temperatures).", "author"=>"Yuzvenko Yaroslav"}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"1"}
